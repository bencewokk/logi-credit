Website starter

See the `website/` folder for a tiny static site you can open in a browser or run locally with npm.

Quick run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install dependencies once
npm install

# start a tiny dev server that serves the website/ folder
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 (lite-server default) or open `website/index.html` directly.
