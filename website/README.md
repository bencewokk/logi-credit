# Website (starter site)

This folder contains a very small static starter website for the Logi Credit project.

How to use

- Note: `website/index.html` is a dev-only, team starter page and may be replaced — treat it as scaffolding for development rather than a production homepage.
- Each team member has a personal page under `website/people/` to add notes and prototype UI. The `people/` pages are the canonical area for individual work and small prototypes.

Structure

- `index.html` – homepage and quick links
- `styles.css` – shared styles
- `app.js` – tiny JS helpers
- `people/` – per-person starter pages

Additions

If you'd like, you can run a tiny local server with npm and `lite-server` to get live reload while you edit.

Quick run (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install dev dependencies once
npm install

# start the dev server from project root
npm start
```

The server will serve the `website/` folder and usually opens a browser at http://localhost:3000.
